# Predict what each of the does.
# a.	7 / 2
# b.	7 // 2
# c.	2 / 0
# d.	1 / (3 // 2)
# e.	1 / 3 // 2
# First make a prediction and modify the appropriate print
# statement with your prediction as shown in
# Part a (part a is completed as an example)
print("prediction for 7 / 2", 3.5)
print("prediction for 7 // 2")
print("prediction for 2 / 0")
print("prediction for 1 / (3 // 2)")
print("prediction for 1 / 3 // 2")

# Then print out each to see if your prediction was correct
# Again part a is completed as an example
print(7 / 2)

# If any of your predictions were different then the result,
# explain the difference or ask me a question in comments
